	* Hashrate estimate for 1+7 days
	* New item for 'Chain Rewrite Days', using 7day hashrate
	* New data based on UTXO-set summary. Note that UTXO-set querying is resource intensive and therefore disabled by default to protect slower nodes. Set `BTCEXP_SLOW_DEVICE_MODE` to `false` in your `.env` file to enjoy associated features:
		* UTXO-set size
		* Total coins in circulation
		* Market cap
	* 24-hour network volume (sum of tx outputs). This value is calculated at app launch and refreshed every 30min.

* Tweaks to data in blocks lists:
	* Simpler timestamp formatting for easy reading
	* Include "Time-to-Mine" (TTM) for each block (with green/red highlighting for "fast"/"slow" (<5min / >15min) blocks)

	* Add total fees
	* Add output volume (if `getblockstats` rpc call is supported, i.e. 0.17.0+)
	* Show %Full instead of weight/size
* Block Detail page improvements
	* New data in "Summary" on Block pages (supported for bitcoind v0.17.0+)

	* Labels for transaction input/output types

	* Coinbase and OP_RETURN items: show ascii data inline with link to show hex data
* New tool `/block-stats` for viewing summarized block data from recent blocks
* New tool `/mining-summary` for viewing summarized mining data from recent blocks
* New tool `/block-analysis` for analyzing the details of transactions in a block.
	* **IMPORTANT**: Use of `/block-analysis` can put heavy memory pressure on this app, depending on the details of the block being analyzed. If your app is crashing, consider setting a higher memory ceiling: `node --max_old_space_size=XXX bin/www` (where `XXX` is measured in MB).
* New tool `/difficulty-history` showing a graph of the history of all difficulty adjustments
